# Vibify Music Visualizer
Vibify is a 3D music visualization application that attempts to convey the emotions of music using affect estimation and real time audio feature extraction. The project was a part of my interaction design master thesis. 

The software utilizes the following wonderful tools: 
-[Meyda](https://meyda.js.org/) for real time audio feature extraction. 
-[Essentia.js](https://mtg.github.io/essentia.js/) for affect estimation. 
-[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering. 

## Features
The visualization uses the affect estimates gathered by essentia.js (happiness, sadness, relaxedness, aggressiveness and danceability) in conjunction with realtime features such as Root Mean Squared and Chroma to dynamically create responsive 3D animations that aim to represent the music sentiments. 


## Installation
Simply clone the repository and open it in your browser. 

## Run
Drop an audio file in the drop area and wait a few moments for the visualization to start.
